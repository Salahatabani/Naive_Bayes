# Feature_Hashing.py
Contains some functions to extract features from a string (name in this example). The code for these functions were mostly imported from my Machine learning class, and the concept of [Hashing Tricks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing) was mainly introduced by my amazing professor Kilian Weinberger.  

# Naive_Bayes.py
The actual implementation of multinomial Naive Bayes. I have also included a demo that uses the Naive Bayes functions to predict whether a name is for a male or female.
